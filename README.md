# Hello-World
Learing Git stuff

I am a 36 year old man exploring coding. 
I am currently working on learning Java through/and making mobile apps as my main focus.
Simultenously working on finishing freeCodeCamp when I feel for it.
Not sure what route I am going, but I like mobile developement, and to me it seemes like native is more fun.
Let's see what I find out about that :)
